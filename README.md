# Timetable Management System for Students and Teachers

The Timetable Management System for Students and Teachers is a Java-based application that provides a user-friendly platform for managing and accessing timetables in educational institutions. This project aims to streamline the scheduling process, enhance organization, and facilitate efficient time management for students and teachers.

## Features

- Separate interfaces for students and teachers to view and manage their respective timetables.
- Timetable generation using both the Greedy Algorithm and Constraint Satisfaction Algorithm.
- User-friendly graphical user interface (GUI) for easy navigation and interaction.

## Interface

## Algorithms Used

- Greedy Algorithm: Assigns subjects to available time slots based on locally optimal choices, considering factors like popularity and availability.
- Constraint Satisfaction Algorithm: Ensures timetables satisfy predefined constraints, such as teacher availability, classroom capacity, and avoiding clashes between subjects.

## Technologies Used

- Java: The core programming language used for implementing the Timetable Management System.
- Java Swing: The GUI framework for developing the user interface.
- Arrays and Lists: Data structures used for storing and managing timetable information.
- Git: Version control system for collaborative development.
